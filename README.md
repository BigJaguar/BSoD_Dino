# BSoD_Dino_Game_Prank
Ever wanted to prank your friend with the Blue Screen of Death, but throw in a twist with the Chrome Dino Game? Well now you can!

The audio files included in this project are from Google Chrome's "Dino Run", aka "Dinosaur Game." To the best of my knowledge, that game was licensed under the GPL v3.0. As such, this project is licensed likewise with the GPL v3.0.

This project makes use of Python, including the Pygame library.

The "install.bat" will take care of installing Python and the Pygame library. Additionally, it will run -ExecutionPolicy Bypass on the project folder so that the Batch script can run without getting flagged by antivirus programs. That being said, PLEASE SCAN THE PROJECT FOLDER UPON DOWNLOADING IT TO ENSURE NO ONE HAS MALICIOUSLY TAMPERED WITH IT!

Honestly, I built this over the course of 2 days and might leave it as it is. Enjoy!
